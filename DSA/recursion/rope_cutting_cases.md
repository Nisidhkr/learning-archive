# Rope Cutting Problem – Recursion Cases (Examples)

The **Rope Cutting Problem**:  
You are given a rope of length `n` and three possible cut lengths `a`, `b`, `c`.  
You can cut the rope into segments of these lengths.  
The goal is to find the **maximum number of pieces** possible.  
If it’s impossible, the result is `-1`.  

Below are **all possible recursion result scenarios** with examples.

---

## **Case 1: Exact division into pieces (many ways possible)**
Rope length can be perfectly cut into pieces using given lengths, possibly in many ways.

**Example:**  
- Rope length: `n = 5`  
- Cuts allowed: `a = 2`, `b = 1`, `c = 5`  
- Possible ways:  
  - `1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1` → **5 pieces** ✅ (maximum)  
  - `2 + 2 + 1` → **3 pieces**  
  - `5` → **1 piece**  
- **Maximum pieces = 5**

---

## **Case 2: Multiple possible ways, pick maximum**
Several cutting sequences possible, but one yields the maximum.

**Example:**  
- Rope length: `n = 7`  
- Cuts allowed: `a = 2`, `b = 3`, `c = 5`  
- Possible ways:  
  - `2 + 2 + 3` → **3 pieces** ✅ (maximum)  
  - `5 + 2` → **2 pieces**  
- **Maximum pieces = 3**

---

## **Case 3: No valid cutting possible**
No combination of given lengths adds up to the rope length.

**Example:**  
- Rope length: `n = 7`  
- Cuts allowed: `a = 2`, `b = 4`, `c = 6`  
- No combination sums to `7`  
- **Answer = -1**

---

## **Case 4: Only one possible valid way**
Only one cutting sequence works.

**Example:**  
- Rope length: `n = 8`  
- Cuts allowed: `a = 3`, `b = 5`, `c = 8`  
- Only valid way: `3 + 5` → **2 pieces**  
- **Maximum pieces = 2**

---

## **Case 5: Need to use full recursion depth (many small cuts)**
The optimal way uses the smallest cut repeatedly.

**Example:**  
- Rope length: `n = 9`  
- Cuts allowed: `a = 2`, `b = 4`, `c = 6`  
- Trying smallest repeatedly: `2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 1` ❌ (invalid leftover)  
- Would require deep recursion search to find any valid option (if it exists).

---

## **Case 6: Ties between different solutions**
Two or more cutting sequences give the same maximum pieces.

**Example:**  
- Rope length: `n = 6`  
- Cuts allowed: `a = 2`, `b = 3`, `c = 4`  
- Possible ways:  
  - `2 + 2 + 2` → **3 pieces** ✅ (maximum)  
  - `3 + 3` → **2 pieces**  
  - `4 + 2` → **2 pieces**  
- Here, only one max exists, but ties can occur with different values.

**Note:** Drawing a recursion tree for one case can help visualize all cutting possibilities.
